# IL-2 Cliffs of Dover Route Planner  

The in-game map tool for IL-2 Cliffs of Dover (Blitz) lacks refinement, requiring players to manually measure flight paths, calculate headings, and determine leg times. The IL-2 CloD Route Planner streamlines this process, making it effortless to plan routes for both single-player and multiplayer missions.
